<h1>Till Death Do Us Part (An Anti-Twilight Love Poem to a Zombie)</h1>

<h2>by Sarah Loltz</h2>

You know I hate flowers, so you always bring brains,<br />
<br />
Your skin gets all mouldy whenever it rains,<br />
<br />
I'll never forget when I first caught your eye,<br />
<br />
And I've still got it here, though it's withered and dry.<br />
<br />
Remember our first date, when we lurched through the mall,<br />
<br />
And you showed me the hole in your abdominal wall?<br />
<br />
How romantic that was! How I laughed till I sobbed,<br />
<br />
How I looked on with awe as you fought off that mob.<br />
<br />
And our first kiss was magic, a true serenade,<br />
<br />
(I'm sure that in time all the bite marks will fade)<br />
<br />
I thought at the time 'how refreshing to find,<br />
<br />
A man so intent to get inside my mindâ€¦'<br />
<br />
My dearest, I tell you, I've made it my mission,<br />
<br />
To try and look past all your decomposition,<br />
<br />
So what if you dance like a reject from Thriller?<br />
<br />
No one can deny you're a real lady killer.<br />
<br />
You may not say much, mostly ugh-hhh and braaaaaiiinnnnns,<br />
<br />
And it can get quite tiring cleaning up all the stains,<br />
<br />
But there's no one alive who can beat you at Twister,<br />
<br />
(And I know that you're sorry for eating my sister)<br />
<br />
You're always so eager to lend me a hand,<br />
<br />
Or an ear, or a leg - and once - a lymph gland,<br />
<br />
I can't meet your parents (they're quite strict at the morgue),<br />
<br />
But I'm sure that I'd like them, and wouldn't get gnawed.<br />
<br />
And don't take to heart all those things my dad said,<br />
<br />
And the cruel joke he made about Dawn of the Dead,<br />
<br />
That chainsaw was just a small misunderstanding,<br />
<br />
And so were the shotguns he keeps on the landing.<br />
<br />
You're my Don Juan, my Romeo - if they were undead,<br />
<br />
And left maggots and brain bits in Juliet's bed.<br />
<br />
So to death us do part, or till decapitation,<br />
<br />
(I'm learning to deal with my undead frustration)<br />
<br />
You're the best - you're my soul mate - a fabulous feller,<br />
<br />
And that's why I keep you, chained up, in my cellar.<br />
