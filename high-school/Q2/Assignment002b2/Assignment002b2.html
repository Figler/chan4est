<h1>Werewolf</h1>
<h2>By Bryan</h2>

<div id="moon"> <img src="Images/littlemoon.png" /> </div>

The moon begins to rise, over a cold and dark town,<br />
A creature roams wild, while the moonlight shines down.<br />
<br />
He is a man by day, as normal as any man could be,<br />
But when the moon shines, everyone can then see.<br />
<br />
What kind of monster he truly is, no one can explain,<br />
So they all stay in fear, as he transforms his eternal pain.<br />
<br />
Feeding on the innocence, his heart is made of stone,<br />
Trapped in this horrible world, forever trapped here alone.<br />
<br />
Never to share this curse, as it eats away his humanity,<br />
Trapped in his mind at night, near to the break of insanity.<br />
<br />
But there is still hope, maybe one day it will finally end,<br />
Then he can be free once more, never to face this again.<br />
<br />
He doesn't want to hurt anyone, but he cant stop the moon,<br />
And he prays he will die, maybe that end will come soon.<br />
<br />
But it doesn't, and again and again more innocence die,<br />
By this horrid monster, with hate filled in his dark eyes.<br />
<br />
But a Werewolf, this is what his heart will forever be,<br />
Trapped in a human, consumed for the rest of eternity.<br />
