            <p>Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein" is a story that will stand the test of time. The plot, in short, is a tale of revenge and how the rejection of society creates horrific effects. A common misconception is that the monster is named Frankenstein but in reality the mad scientist, who creates the iconic monster, is named Victor Frankenstein while the monster has no real name. It's only referred to as the creature or the monster. Shelley wrote Frankenstein one summer while staying in Geneva Switzerland because of a bet she had with a couple of friends to see who could write the scariest ghost story. Sure enough she won. Mary had to publish the book anonymously three times before becoming officially recognized as the true author of one of the best English novels of all time.</p>

<p>I personally chose the book Frankenstein as my topic because I read it this year in Mr. Lucero's English class. The storyline was still fresh in my mind and when the words "legends project" resonated through my mind I came to an epiphany that I should do the project on the book itself. Everyone knows the creature's look from Halloween and the novel itself is legendary as well so it made met the perfect criteria as a topic for the legends project. I think everyone should take the time to thoroughly read the book and experience the feelings of betrayal, and revenge through the eyes of Victor and his creature.
